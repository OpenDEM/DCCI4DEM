# DCCI4DEM
Edge-directed image upsampling for Digital Elevation Models (DEM).

Have a look at [https://opendem.info/dcci.html](https://opendem.info/dcci.html) for detailed information. 

The implementation is based on Organa HQX implementation on [GitHub](https://github.com/revent-studio/organa_hqx).

An implementation of Directional Cubic Convolution Interpolation (DCCI) proposed in:
[D. Zhou1, X. Shen & W. Dong. "Image zooming using directional cubic convolution interpolation. 2012.](https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-ipr.2011.0534)

The Notebook is running on Google Colab with data storage on Google Drive. Of course this could be adapted to local resources
